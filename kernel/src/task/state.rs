/// executable program is attached, or the task is explicitly marked as ready,
/// the kernel assumes there is no code to run, so the task is ignored.
///
/// When a task is Running, the kernel assumes that it can be safely executed.
/// The scheduler will consider this task as a candidate for the next one to
/// run.
///
/// When a program crashes, exits, or is killed by a soft interrupt, it moves
/// to a Terminated state. This allows the task data to remain in memory until
/// the kernel is able to notify its parent and clean up the resources
/// associated with the terminated task. A kernel-level task regularly walks
/// the task map and handles any terminated tasks.
///
/// A task becomes Blocked when it wants to pause execution and yield the CPU
/// to other tasks. This may be waiting for a fixed amount of time (sleeping)
/// or blocking until hardware or another task is ready. The Blocked state
/// contains information on what conditions will allow the task to resume
/// execution, as well as an optional timeout. This allows every blocking
/// operation to resume even if the condition is never met, so that tasks
/// can avoid blocking indefinitely.
///
/// State alones doesn't make a task runnable. The scheduler must place the task
/// on one of the run queues. Tasks start as Uninitialized, and are not placed
/// on a run queue until they are marked as Initialized. The first time an
/// Initialized task is picked up by the scheduler, it is switched to Running.
/// As long as it remains Running, it will be placed on another run queue when
/// it yields or its time slice is up.
/// A task can become invalid for scheduling if it terminates or blocks. In
/// those cases it is not removed from a run queue, but if the scheduler
/// encounters a non-runnable task it will not re-enqueue it.
